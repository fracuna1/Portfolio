# 💼 Felicia Acuna – Technical Portfolio

Welcome! This is my personal portfolio showcasing projects across software engineering, DevOps, IT automation, data analysis, and more. I've organized everything by category so it's easy to explore the areas I’ve worked in — each folder includes hands-on projects with documentation, source code, and tools I’ve used.

Whether you're a recruiter, hiring manager, or fellow developer, feel free to take a look around. I’m always building and learning, so this space will continue to grow.
