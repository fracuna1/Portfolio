# 📦 Shipping Insights

A lightweight ETL pipeline for retail logistics analytics. This project simulates the process of extracting shipment manifest data, cleaning and transforming it using Python, and loading it into a relational database for analysis. The goal is to generate actionable insights for operations teams monitoring delivery performance and shipping KPIs.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas**
- **SQLite**
- **CSV Files**
- (Optional) **Jupyter Notebook** for data exploration

---

## 🔄 Workflow

1. **Extract**  
   - Import shipment data from raw CSV files (e.g., deliveries.csv, carriers.csv).

2. **Transform**  
   - Normalize date formats  
   - Remove null or duplicate entries  
   - Calculate shipping delay (`actual_delivery_date - expected_delivery_date`)  
   - Categorize shipments by region, status, or carrier

3. **Load**  
   - Save cleaned and transformed data into SQLite database tables  
   - Generate SQL reports with aggregate metrics

---

## 📊 Example Features

- Identify delayed vs. on-time shipments
- Average delivery time by region or carrier
- Carrier performance metrics
- Filterable summary views using SQL
