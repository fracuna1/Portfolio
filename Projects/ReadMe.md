# Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Engineering project portfolio. This collection showcases a range of practical, end-to-end solutions I've built to simulate real-world business needs across various industries including logistics, retail, compliance, and analytics. Each project highlights my ability to work with databases, pipelines, automation, dashboards, and scripting tools commonly used in modern data engineering workflows.
